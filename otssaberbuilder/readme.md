Unofficial OTS Saber Configurator 1.1.1

To start the tool, visit: mtobisch.github.io/otssaberbuilder
	
This tool lets you configure a LED saber from Ken Hampton's OTS lightsaber product line. Current features:
- Mix and match any saber parts in whatever order
- Modding the build on the fly
- Zoom and Drag options, including mobile pinch
- Ability to save and load builds
- Builds directly saved in URL
- Random lightsaber function
- Change background function
- Saber parts printed
- Info about part count
	
The following is still planned:
- Add info about saber length and cost
- Perhaps add TCSS parts
	
Note that this project is in no way officially associated with HHCLS or Ken Hampton and is a pure fan project to practice my web development skills. 
I hope you have as much fan using this app as I had building it.

May the force be with you!
